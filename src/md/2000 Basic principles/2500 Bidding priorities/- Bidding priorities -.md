## <a name="Bidding_priorities"> Bidding priorities

_Coming soon..._

(* TODO-NMB:

     - with a balanced hand, open in no-trumps with appropriate HCP - or open in a suit and plan to bid no-trumps with your second bid (depending on partner's response)...
     - with a semi-balanced or unbalanced hand (other than 4441), open in your longest (5-card or longer) suit - and plan to bid your second-longest (4-card or longer) suit with your second bid (depending on partner's response)...
     - ...and with a 4441 hand: tell the least bad lie...
     - rebidding a suit promises additional length (or a very strong suit)...

     - Inferences:

        -- (depending on partner's response) if either of opener's first two bids are in no-trumps, opener has a balanced hand...
        -- (depending on partner's response) if opener's first two bids are in different suits, opener has at least 5 cards in the suit bid first - and at least 4-cards in the suit bid second...
        -- (depending on partner's response) if opener's first two bids are in the same suit, opener has at least 6-cards in the suit (or a very strong 5-card suit)... *)
