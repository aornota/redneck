_Coming soon..._

(* TODO-NMB:

     - by playing the highest card of the suit led (assuming no-one is able and willing to play a trump)...
     - by leading a card from a suit in which no-one else has any cards (assuming no-one is able and willing to play a trump)...
     - by having no cards in the suit led and playing a trump (assuming no-one is able and willing to play a higher trump)...

     - conclusions:

        -- high cards are good - especially Aces (and to a lesser extent Kings) as these are less likely to get trumped...
        -- long suits are good - even a humble Two can win a trick - as long as you get the chance to lead your length winners...
        -- cards in the trump suit are good - especially if you have shortage in other suits... *)
