### <a name="1NT_opening_bid"> {1NT} opening bid

_Work-in-progress..._

(* TODO-NMB:

     - all balanced hands wih 12-14 HCP should be opened {1NT} - except (by partnership agreement) the worst hands with 12 HCP should be passed in some circumstances, e.g.:

        -- whenever vulnerable?...
        -- at unfavourable vulnerability?...
        -- never in third seat (since pre-emptive)?...
        -- always in fourth seat?...

     - in fourth seat (i.e. after three passes), balanced hands with 15 HCP should also be opened {1NT}...

     - balanced hands with a 5-card major should almost always be opened {1NT} (since rebid problems) - unless (by partnership agreement) clearly "one-suited"...

     - (by partnership agreement) some 5422 (semi-balanced) hands can also be opened {1NT}, e.g.:

        -- if bidding the 5-card suit then the 4-card suit would be a "reverse" (since not strong enough)?...
        -- if scattered values (and not two useless doubletons)?...

     - (by partnership agreement) some 6322 (semi-balanced) hands with a 6-card minor can also be opened {1NT}... *)

A balanced hand with 13 HCP and scattered honours - and 2Â½ quick tricks - that should be opened {1NT} (with no need to worry about the useless doubleton because if partner is strong enough to respond, there is a good chance that they will have something useful in the spade suit):

> {| s:84 h:AQJ6 d:J932 c:KQ7 --shape --hcp |}

A balanced hand with 12 HCP - but 4333 and "quacky" with poor intermediates and only 1 quick trick - that could be passed (by partnership agreement):

> {| s:QJ2 h:J82 d:QJ63 c:KQ5 --shape --hcp |}

A balanced hand with 14 HCP and a 5-card major that should be opened {1NT}:

> {| s:AT h:KJ965 d:AT2 c:Q98 --shape --hcp |}

A clearly "one-suited" balanced hand with a 5-card major that could be opened {1S} (by partnership agreement):

> {| s:AKQJ9 h:43 d:J62 c:J76 --shape --hcp |}

A semi-balanced (5422) hand that could be opened {1NT} (by partnership agreement):

> {| s:T7 h:A4 d:KJT6 c:KQ983 --shape --hcp |}

A semi-balanced (6322) hand with a 6-card minor that could be opened {1NT} (by partnership agreement):

> {| s:K64 h:K8 d:JT c:AQJ973 --shape --hcp |}
