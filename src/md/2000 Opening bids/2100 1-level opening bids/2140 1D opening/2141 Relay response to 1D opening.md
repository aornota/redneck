#### <a name="Relay_response_to_1D_opening"> Relay response to {1D} opening

When responder has ca. 8+ HCP - or ca. 7 HCP or less and no 5+ card suit - they should make a relay response of {1H}.

If opener has a 10-b12 HCP hand, they should rebid {1S}. Responder then rebids as follows:

- With ca. 7 HCP or less and no 5+ card suit, they should bid {1NT}. Opener must pass.
- With a less-than-invitational hand - ca. 8-b13 HCP - and no 5+ card major (or 6+ card minor) - they should bid {1NT}. Opener must pass. (With a 5+ card major, they should transfer - as over a {1NT} opening bid - and pass opener's forced rebid. With a 6+ card minor, they might transfer and pass opener's forced response if they feel that {3D} or {3C} will be better than {1NT}.)
- Otherwise, responder's rebids are analogous to the [responses to a 1NT opening bid](#Responses_to_1NT_opening) (albeit taking into account that opener's point range is 10-b12 HCP, not g12-14 HCP).

If opener has a 15-17 HCP hand, they should rebid {1NT}. Responder's rebids are analogous to the [responses to a 1NT opening bid](#Responses_to_1NT_opening) (albeit taking into account that opener's point range is 15-17 HCP, not g12-14 HCP).
