### <a name="1D_opening"> {1D} opening

All balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hands with either 10-b12 HCP (where b12 means "bad 12") or 15-17 HCP should be opened {1D} - except that a 5332 hand with 15-17 HCP and a 5-card major can be opened [{1S}](#1S_opening) or [{1H}](#1H_opening) if it does not feel "no-trumpy", e.g. if values are concentrated in the major. (A 5332 hand with 10-b12 HCP and a 5-card major will rarely satisfy the "rule of 20" and should only be opened {1D}.)

A {1D} opening bid is forcing, with one exception: if responder has less-than-invitational strength (even if partner has a 15-17 HCP hand) - ca. 7 HCP or less - and has 5+ diamonds, they can pass.
