### <a name="1D_opening"> {1D} opening

All balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hands with either 10-b12 HCP (where b12 means "bad 12") or 15-17 HCP should be opened {1D} - except that a 5332 hand with 15-17 HCP and a 5-card major can be opened [{1S}](#1S_opening) or [{1H}](#1H_opening) if it does not feel "no-trumpy", e.g. if values are concentrated in the major.

(A 5332 hand with 10-b12 HCP and a 5-card major will rarely satisfy the "rule of 20" and should only be opened {1D}.)

A {1D} opening bid is forcing, with one exception: when responder has less-than-invitational strength even if opener has a 15-17 HCP hand - ca. 7 HCP or less - with 5+ diamonds, they can pass.

(See [weak transfer responses](#Weak_transfer_responses_to_1D_opening) for when responder has ca. 7 HCP or less and a different 5+ card suit - and [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1D_opening) for when responder has ca. 7 HCP or less and no 5+ card suit.)

By partnership agreement, you might decide only to open the 10-b12 HCP hands in some circumstances, e.g. only when non-vulnerable or only at favourable vulnerability.

##### Some examples

A balanced hand with 10 HCP that should be opened {1D}:

> {| s:A7 h:QJ5 d:J9872 c:Q54 --shape --hcp |}

A balanced hand with 16 HCP that should be opened {1D}:

> {| s:A974 h:Q9 d:AK87 c:QJ3 --shape --hcp |}
