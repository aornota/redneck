When responder has ca. 6+ HCP, they should make a positive response of {1H}.

Opener rebids as follows:

- With both minor suits (at least 5-4) and minimum strength, they rebid {1S}.
    - Responder can then relay with {1NT} to ask opener to rebid their longer (or stronger if equal length) minor at the 2-level - or, if short in both minors, improvise some other bid.
- With a balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hand and 19-21 HCP, they rebid {1NT}.
    - Responder's rebids are analogous to the [responses to a 1NT opening bid](#Responses_to_1NT_opening) (albeit taking into account that opener's point range is 19-21 HCP, not 13-15 HCP).
- With 6+ clubs and mininum strength, they rebid {2C}.
- With 6+ diamonds and mininum strength, they rebid {2D}.
- With both minor suits (at least 5-4) and a strong hand, they rebid {2S}.
    - Responder can then relay with {2NT} to ask opener to rebid their longer (or stronger if equal length) minor at the 3-level - or, if short in both minors, improvise some other bid.
- With 6+ clubs and a strong hand, they rebid {3C}.
- With 6+ diamonds and a strong hand, they rebid {3D}.
