#### <a name="Weak_jump_responses_to_1C_opening"> Weak "jump" responses to {1C} opening

When responder has a very weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) - such that their hand is essentially worthless unless their suit is the trump suit - they can make a weak "jump" response of {1S}, {2C}, {2D} or {2H}. (Note that {1S} and {2C} are not technically jumps over {1C}.)

Opener should usually pass, though may choose to do otherwise with a strong hand and a good fit for responder's long suit (or if they feel than playing in their long minor will be better).

##### An example

A very weak hand with long spades that should make a weak "jump" response of {1S}:
