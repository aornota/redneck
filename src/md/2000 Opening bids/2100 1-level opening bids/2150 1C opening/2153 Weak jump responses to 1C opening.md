If responder has a very weak hand with a long (ideally 7+) suit - such that their hand is essentially worthless until their suit is the trump suit - they can make a weak "jump" response of {1S}, {2C}, {2D} or {2H}. (Note than {1S} and {2C} are not technically jumps over {1C}.)

Opener should usually pass, though may choose to do otherwise with a strong hand and a good fit for responder's long suit.

##### An example

A very weak hand with long hearts that should make a weak "jump" response of {2H}:
