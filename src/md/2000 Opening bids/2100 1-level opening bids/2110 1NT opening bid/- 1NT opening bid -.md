### <a name="1NT_opening_bid"> {1NT} opening bid

All balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hands with g12-14 HCP (where g12 means "good 12") should be opened {1NT} - except that a 5332 hand with a 5-card major can be opened {1S} or {1H} if it does not feel "no-trumpy" (e.g. if values are concentrated in the major).

#### Some examples

A balanced hand with 13 HCP and scattered honours that should be opened {1NT}:

> {| s:84 h:AQJ6 d:J932 c:KQ7 --shape --hcp |}

A balanced hand with a "good" 12 HCP - TODO-NMB... - that should be opened {1NT}:

> TODO-NMB...
