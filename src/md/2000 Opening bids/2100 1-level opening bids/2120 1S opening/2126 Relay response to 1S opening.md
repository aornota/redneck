#### <a name="Relay_response_to_1S_opening"> Relay response to {1S} opening

When responder has an invitational-or-better hand - ca. 10+ HCP - and fewer than 4 spades, they should make a relay response of {2C}.

If minimum, opener rebids as follows:

- {2D} shows either a three-suited hand (with a singleton or void in hearts) or a 5322 hand.
    - Responder then relays with {2H} and opener rebids as follows:
        - {2S} shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in hearts.
        - {2NT} shows a 5332 hand.
- {2H} shows clubs (at least 5-4 or 4-5 in spades and clubs).
- {2S} shows a single-suited hand with 6+ spades.
- {2NT} shows diamonds (at least 5-4 or 4-5 in spades and diamonds).

Note that - unlike after a [relay response to a {1H} opening bid](#Relay_response_to_1H_opening) - opener's rebids are often unnatural (i.e. not showing 4+ cards in the suit bid). Therefore opener's immediate {2H} and {2NT} rebids hould be treated as semi-forcing (albeit responder will occasionally decide to pass with an appropriate hand).

If strong, opener rebids as above but a level higher; this establishes a game-force.
