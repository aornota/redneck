#### <a name="1NT_response_to_1H_opening"> {1NT} response to {1H} opening

When responder has ca. 6-9 HCP and fewer than 4 hearts, they should make a non-forcing response of {1NT}.

(Note that this response does not promise a balanced hand.)

If opener has a strong and/or very unbalanced hand, they can rebid as follows:

    - {2C}, {2D}, and {2S} promise 5+ cards in that suit.
    - {2H} promises 6+ hearts.
    - {2NT} shows a 5332 hand.
