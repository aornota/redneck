### <a name="1H_opening"> {1H} opening

All unbalanced hands (and the occasional 5332 hand) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ hearts are opened {1H}.

Note that these hands might have a longer (or equal length) spade suit and/or a longer (or equal length) minor suit.

A {1H} opening bid is not forcing.

##### Responses to {1H} opening

If responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) other than hearts - such that their hand is essentially worthless unless their suit is the trump suit - they should make a [weak "jump" response](#Weak_jump_responses_to_1H_opening).

If responder has a weak hand (ca. 6 HCP or less) with 4+ hearts, they should make a [pre-emptive response](#Pre-emptive_responses_to_1H_opening).

If responder has 4+ hearts and ca. 7-12 HCP, they should make a [Bergen response](#Bergen_responses_to_1H_opening).

If responder has 4+ hearts and ca. 13+ HCP, they should make a [Jacoby {2NT} response](#Jacoby_2NT_response_to_1H_opening) - or, with a singleton or void, they might prefer a [splinter response](#Splinter_responses_to_1H_opening) instead.

If responder has an invitational-or-better hand - ca. 10+ HCP - and fewer than 3 hearts, they should make a [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1H_opening).

If responder has ca. 6-9 HCP, fewer than 3 hearts, and no long suit, they should respond {1NT}.

// TODO-NMB: What about {3NT} ("pudding") response? What about {4S} (Kickback) response?...

Otherwise, responder should pass.
