### <a name="1H_opening"> {1H} opening

All unbalanced hands (and the occasional 5332 hand) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ hearts are opened {1H}.

Note that these hands might have a longer (or equal length) spade suit and/or a longer (or equal length) minor suit.

A {1H} opening bid is not forcing.
