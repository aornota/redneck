#### <a name="Relay_response_to_1H_opening"> Relay response to {1H} opening

When responder has an invitational-or-better hand - ca. 10+ HCP - and fewer than 4 hearts, they should make a relay response of {1S}.

If minimum, opener rebids as follows:

- {1NT} shows either a three-suited hand (4441 or 5440) or a 5322 hand.
    - Responder then relays with {2C} and opener rebids:
        - {2D} shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in spades.
        - {2H} shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in diamonds.
        - {2S} shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in clubs.
        - {2NT} shows a 5332 hand.
- {2C} shows clubs (at least 5-4 or 4-5 in hearts and clubs).
- {2D} shows diamonds (at least 5-4 or 4-5 in hearts and diamonds).
- {2H} shows a single-suited hand with 6+ hearts.
- {2S} shows spades (at least 5-4 or 4-5 in hearts and spades).

Note that other than the {1NT} rebid (which forces responder to relay with {2C}), opener's rebids are natural - showing 4+ cards in the suit bid - and non-forcing.

If strong, opener rebids as above but a level higher; this establishes a game-force.
