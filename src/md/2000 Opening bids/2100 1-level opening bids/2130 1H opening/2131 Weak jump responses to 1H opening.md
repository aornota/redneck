#### <a name="Weak_jump_responses_to_1H_opening"> Weak "jump" responses to {1H} opening

When responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) other than hearts, they should make a weak "jump" response of {2C}, {2D} or {2S}. (Note that {2C} and {2D} are not technically jumps over {1H}.)

Opener should usually pass, though may choose to do otherwise with a strong hand and a good fit for responder's long suit (or if they feel than playing in their long suit will be better).

##### An example

A very weak hand with long diamonds that should make a weak "jump" response of {1D}:

> {| s:T8 h:5 d:Q975432 c:T52 --shape --hcp |}
