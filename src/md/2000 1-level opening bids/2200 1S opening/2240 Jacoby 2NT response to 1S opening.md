### <a name="Jacoby_2NT_response_to_1S_opening"> Jacoby {2NT} response to {1S} opening

When responder has 4+ spades and ca. 13+ HCP, they should make a game-forcing response of {2NT}.

(However, with a singleton or void - but not a singleton Ace - they might prefer a [splinter response](#Splinter_responses_to_1S_opening) instead.)

Opener rebids as follows:

- A new suit at the 3-level shows a singleton or void (but not a singleton Ace).
- A new suit at the 4-level shows a good suit (ideally 5+ cards and at least two of the top three honours).
- {3S} shows a strong hand with 5+ spades.
- {3NT} shows a strong hand with exactly 4 spades.
- {4S} shows a minimum hand.
