### <a name="1NT_response_to_1S_opening"> {1NT} response to {1S} opening

When responder has ca. 6-9 HCP and fewer than 4 spades, they should make a non-forcing response of {1NT}.

(Note that this response does not promise a balanced hand.)

If opener has a strong and/or very unbalanced hand, they can rebid as follows:

- {2C}, {2D}, and {2H} promise 5+ cards in the suit bid.
- {2S} promises 6+ spades.
- {2NT} shows a 5332 hand.

If opener has a near maximum hand, they can rebid as above but a level higher, which is encouraging but not forcing.
