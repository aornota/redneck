### <a name="1NT_response_to_1S_opening"> {1NT} response to {1S} opening

When responder has ca. 6-11 HCP and fewer than 4 spades, they should make a non-forcing response of {1NT}.

(Note that this response does not promise a balanced hand.)

If opener is minimum, they can pass (though they might prefer to bid with a very unbalanced hand). Otherwise, opener should rebid as follows:

- {2C} and {2D} promise 4+ cards in the suit bid.
    - Note that after a {1S} opening bid and {1NT} response, opener cannot need to show a heart suit with 4+ cards: with 4+ cards in both majors, they would have opened {1H} rather than {1S}. Therefore the {2H} rebid can be used for another purpose.
    - Note also that if opener does not have 4+ cards in either minor, they must either have a 5332 hand that they decided was not "no-trumpy" - or 6+ spades.
- {2H} promises exactly 6 spades (and denies 4+ cards in any other suit, therefore a 6322 or 6331 hand).
- {2S} promises 7+ spades.
- {2NT} shows a 5332 hand.

Responder should rarely pass with an invitiational hand (ca. 9-11 HCP), though they might do so if they suspect a misfit.

If opener has a very strong hand, they can rebid as above but a level higher, which is encouraging but not forcing.
