Redneck is an experimental Bridge bidding system invented by Jack and Neph after one bottle of wine too many.

It has the following notable features:

- All balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hands with 10-19 HCP can be shown - divided into four separate HCP ranges - at the 1-level (assuming no interference).
- All unbalanced hands with ca. 11-19 HCP and containing at least one 4-card or longer major suit are opened [{1S}](#1S_opening) or [{1H}](#1H_opening), even if they have a longer minor suit.
- All unbalanced hands with ca. 11-19 HCP and without a 4-card or longer major suit are opened [{1C}](#1C_opening).

1-level openings bids are as follows (where g12 means "good 12" and b12 means "bad 12"):

- [{1NT}](#1NT_opening) shows a balanced hand with g12-14 HCP. This bid is not forcing.
- [{1S}](#1S_opening) shows an unbalanced hand (or 5332) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ spades and fewer than 4 hearts. It might have a longer (or equal length) minor suit. This bid is not forcing.
- [{1H}](#1H_opening) shows an unbalanced hand (or 5332) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ hearts. It might have a longer (or equal length) spade suit or a longer (or equal length) minor suit. This bid is not forcing.
- [{1D}](#1D_opening) shows a balanced hand with either 10-b12 HCP or 15-17 HCP. This bid is forcing (with one exception).
- [{1C}](#1C_opening) shows either an unbalanced hand with ca. 11-19 HCP and without a 4-card or longer major - or a balanced hand with 18-19 HCP. This bid is forcing.
