Redneck is an experimental Bridge bidding system invented by Jack and Neph after one bottle of wine too many.

It has the following notable features:

- All balanced (4333, 4432 or 5332) hands with 10-21 HCP can be shown - divided into four separate HCP ranges - at the 1-level (assuming no interference).
- All unbalanced hands with ca. 11-19 HCP and containing at least one 4-card or longer major suit are opened [{1S}](#-1s-opening) or [{1H}](#-1h-opening), even if they have a longer (or equal length) minor suit.
- All unbalanced hands with ca. 11-19 HCP and without a 4-card or longer major suit are opened [{1C}](#-1c-opening).

Specifically, the 1-level openings bids are as follows:

- [{1NT}](#-1nt-opening) shows a balanced hand with 13-15 HCP. (By partnership agreement, the best 12 HCP balanced hands can also be included.) This bid is not forcing.
- [{1S}](#-1s-opening) shows an unbalanced hand (or occasionally 5332) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ spades and fewer than 4 hearts. It might have a longer (or equal length) minor suit. This bid is not forcing.
- [{1H}](#-1h-opening) shows an unbalanced hand (or occasionally 5332) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ hearts. It might have a longer (or equal length) spade suit and/or a longer (or equal length) minor suit. This bid is not forcing.
- [{1D}](#-1d-opening) shows a balanced hand with either 10-12 HCP or 16-18 HCP. (As noted above, by partnership agreement, the best 12 HCP balanced hands can be opened {1NT} instead.) This bid is forcing (with one exception).
- [{1C}](#-1c-opening) shows either an unbalanced hand with ca. 11-19 HCP and without a 4-card or longer major - or a balanced hand with 19-21 HCP. This bid is forcing.
