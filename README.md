# <a name="Introduction"> Introduction

Redneck is an experimental Bridge bidding system invented by Jack and Neph after one bottle of wine too many.

It has the following notable features:

- All balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hands with 10-19 HCP can be shown - divided into four separate HCP ranges - at the 1-level (assuming no interference).
- All unbalanced hands with ca. 11-19 HCP and containing at least one 4-card or longer major suit are opened 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) or 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png), even if they have a longer minor suit.
- All unbalanced hands with ca. 11-19 HCP and without a 4-card or longer major suit are opened 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png).

1-level openings bids are as follows (where g12 means "good 12" and b12 means "bad 12"):

- 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows a balanced hand with g12-14 HCP. This bid is not forcing.
- 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) shows an unbalanced hand (or 5332) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ spades and fewer than 4 hearts. It might have a longer minor suit. This bid is not forcing.
- 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) shows an unbalanced hand (or 5332) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ hearts. It might have a longer spade suit or a longer minor suit. This bid is not forcing.
- 1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) shows a balanced hand with either 10-b12 HCP or 15-17 HCP. This bid is forcing (with one exception).
- 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) shows either an unbalanced hand with ca. 11-19 HCP and without a 4-card or longer major - or a balanced hand with 18-19 HCP. This bid is not forcing.
