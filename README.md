# <a name="Introduction"> Introduction

Redneck is an experimental Bridge bidding system invented by Jack and Neph after one bottle of wine too many.

It has the following notable features:

- All balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hands with 10-21 HCP can be shown - divided into four separate HCP ranges - at the 1-level (assuming no interference).
- All unbalanced hands with ca. 11-19 HCP and containing at least one 4-card or longer major suit are opened [1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)](#1S_opening) or [1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)](#1H_opening), even if they have a longer (or equal length) minor suit.
- All unbalanced hands with ca. 11-19 HCP and without a 4-card or longer major suit are opened [1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png)](#1C_opening).

Specifically, the 1-level openings bids are as follows:

- [1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png)](#1NT_opening) shows a balanced hand with 13-15 HCP. (By partnership agreement, the best 12 HCP balanced hands can also be included.) This bid is not forcing.
- [1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)](#1S_opening) shows an unbalanced hand (or occasionally 5332) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ spades and fewer than 4 hearts. It might have a longer (or equal length) minor suit. This bid is not forcing.
- [1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)](#1H_opening) shows an unbalanced hand (or occasionally 5332) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ hearts. It might have a longer (or equal length) spade suit and/or a longer (or equal length) minor suit. This bid is not forcing.
- [1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png)](#1D_opening) shows a balanced hand with either 10-12 HCP or 16-18 HCP. (As noted above, by partnership agreement, the best 12 HCP balanced hands can be opened 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) instead.) This bid is forcing (with one exception).
- [1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png)](#1C_opening) shows either an unbalanced hand with ca. 11-19 HCP and without a 4-card or longer major - or a balanced hand with 19-21 HCP. This bid is forcing.

## <a name="1NT_opening"> 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) opening

All balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hands with 13-15 HCP should be opened 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) - except that a 5332 hand with a 5-card major can be opened [1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)](#1S_opening) or [1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)](#1H_opening) if it does not feel "no-trumpy", e.g. if values are concentrated in the major.

A 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) opening bid is not forcing.

By partnership agreement, you might also open 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) (rather than [1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png)](#1D_opening)) with the best 12 HCP balanced hands.

##### Some examples

A balanced hand with 14 HCP and scattered honours that should be opened 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png):

A balanced hand with a "good" 12 HCP - decent 5-card suit with good intermediates and 2 quick tricks  - that could be opened 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) by partnership agreement:

A balanced hand with a "bad" 12 HCP - 4333 and "quacky" with poor intermediates and only 1 quick trick - that should be opened [1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png)](#1D_opening) instead:

A balanced hand with 13 HCP and values concentrated in the 5-card major that could be opened [1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)](#1S_opening) instead:

#### Responses to 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) opening

These are all fairly standard: Stayman; transfers; quantitative; and so on.

_Details to follow..._



## <a name="1S_opening"> 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

All unbalanced hands (and the occasional 5332 hand) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ spades and fewer than 4 hearts are opened 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).

Note that these hands might have a longer (or equal length) minor suit.

A 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening bid is not forcing.

##### Some examples

_Coming soon..._


#### Responses to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

If responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) other than spades - such that their hand is essentially worthless unless their suit is the trump suit - they should make a [weak response](#Weak_responses_to_1S_opening) (2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png), 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) or 3![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png)).

If responder has a weak hand (ca. 6 HCP or less) with 4+ spades, they should make a [pre-emptive response](#Pre-emptive_responses_to_1S_opening) (2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png), 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) or 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)) - or pass with a very weak hand with exactly 4 spades and no singleton or void.

If responder has 4+ spades and ca. 7-11 HCP, they should make a [Bergen response](#Bergen_responses_to_1S_opening) (3![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) or 3![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)).

If responder has 4+ spades and ca. 12+ HCP, they should make a [Jacoby 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response](#Jacoby_2NT_response_to_1S_opening) - or, with a singleton or void (but not a singleton Ace) they might prefer a [splinter response](#Splinter_responses_to_1S_opening) instead (4![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png), 4![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) or 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)).

If responder has a game-forcing hand - ca. 12+ HCP - and fewer than 4 spades, they should make a [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1S_opening) (2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png)).

If responder has ca. 6-11 HCP and fewer than 4 spades, they should [respond 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png)](#1NT_response_to_1S_opening).


Otherwise, responder should pass.

### <a name="Weak_responses_to_1S_opening"> Weak responses to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

When responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) other than spades, they should make a weak response of 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png), 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) or 3![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png). (These are analogous to weak jump responses in a standard system.)

Opener should usually pass, though may choose to do otherwise with a strong hand and a good fit for responder's long suit (or if they feel that playing in their long suit will be better).

##### An example

A very weak hand with long hearts that should make a weak response of 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png):

> ![spade](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/spade.png)3![heart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/heart.png)KT975432![diamond](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/diamond.png)862![club](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/club.png)5 -- very unbalanced (_1_=**8**=3=_1_) | 3 HCP

### <a name="Pre-emptive_responses_to_1S_opening"> Pre-emptive responses to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

When responder has a weak hand (ca. 6 HCP or less) with 4+ spades, they should make a pre-emptive raise in spades:

- With a "weak freak" - 6+ spades and a singleton or void - they should bid 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).
- With 5+ spades - and ideally a singleton or void when vulnerable - they should bid 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).
- With exactly 4 spades - or 5+ but no singleton or void - they should bid 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).

(However, with a very weak hand, exactly 4 spades, and no singleton or void, they should usually pass.)

Opener will usually pass the pre-emptive raise; with a strong hand, they might be able to bid 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) - or, if interested in game following a 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) response, they can:

- Bid a new suit at the cheapest level (i.e. 3![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png), 3![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) or 3![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)) to show a weak suit where they fear too many quick losers.
    - If responder has a 1-loser holding in the suit, they bid 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png); otherwise, they bid 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).
- Bid 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) to show poor quality spades (e.g. something like T9643).
    - If responder has two honours in spades, they bid 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png); otherwise, they pass.

### <a name="Bergen_responses_to_1S_opening"> Bergen responses to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

When responder has 4+ spades and ca. 7-11 HCP, they shuuld bid as follows:

- With 7-9 HCP, they bid 3![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png). Opener can:
    - Rebid 3![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) to invite game (with responder signing-off in 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) or 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)).
    - Sign-off in 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) or 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).
    - Explore for slam.
- With 10-11 HCP, they bid 3![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png). Opener can sign-off in 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) or 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png), or explore for slam.

### <a name="Jacoby_2NT_response_to_1S_opening"> Jacoby 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

When responder has 4+ spades and ca. 12+ HCP, they should make a game-forcing response of 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png).

(However, with a singleton or void - but not a singleton Ace - they might prefer a [splinter response](#Splinter_responses_to_1S_opening) instead.)

Opener rebids as follows:

- A new suit at the 3-level shows a singleton or void (but not a singleton Ace).
- A new suit - other than hearts - at the 4-level shows a good suit (ideally 5+ cards and at least two of the top three honours).
    - Note that after a 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening bid and 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response, opener cannot need to show a good heart suit: with 4+ cards in both majors, they would have opened 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) rather than 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png). Therefore the 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) rebid can be used for another purpose.
- 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) shows a strong hand with 5+ spades.
- 3![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows a strong hand with exactly 4 spades.
- 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) shows a minimum hand with 5+ spades.
- 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) shows a minimum hand with exactly 4 spades.

### <a name="Splinter_responses_to_1S_opening"> Splinter responses to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

When responder has 4+ spades, ca. 12+ HCP, and a singleton or void (but not a singleton Ace), they should make a game-forcing double-jump response:

- 4![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) shows a singleton or void in clubs.
- 4![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) shows a singleton or void in diamonds.
- 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) shows a singleton or void in hearts.

(However, by partnership agreement, a strong responder might prefer a [Jacoby 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response](#Jacoby_2NT_response_to_1S_opening) instead, e.g. if they want to find out more about opener's hand rather than telling opener about their singleton or void.)

### <a name="Relay_response_to_1S_opening"> Relay response to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

When responder has a game-forcing hand - ca. 12+ HCP - and fewer than 4 spades, they should make a relay response of 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png).

Opener rebids as follows:

- 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) shows either a three-suited hand (4441 or 5440) with a singleton or void in hearts or a 5322 hand.
    - Responder then relays with 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) and opener rebids as follows:
        - 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in hearts.
        - 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows a 5332 hand.
- 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) shows clubs with equal or longer spades (i.e. at least 5-4 in spades and clubs).
- 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) shows a single-suited hand with 6+ spades.
- 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows diamonds with equal or longer spades (i.e. at least 5-4 in spades and diamonds).
- 3![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) shows longer clubs (i.e. at least 4-5 in spades and clubs).
- 3![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) shows longer diamonds (i.e. at least 4-5 in spades and diamonds).

### <a name="1NT_response_to_1S_opening"> 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

When responder has ca. 6-11 HCP and fewer than 4 spades, they should make a non-forcing response of 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png).

(Note that this response does not promise a balanced hand.)

If opener is minimum, they can pass (though they might prefer to bid with a very unbalanced hand). Otherwise, opener should rebid as follows:

- 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) and 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) show 4+ cards in the suit bid and exactly 4 spades (therefore at least 5+ cards in the suit bid unless opener has a 4=1=4=4 hand).
    - Note that after a 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening bid and 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response, opener cannot need to show a heart suit with 4+ cards: with 4+ cards in both majors, they would have opened 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) rather than 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png). Therefore the 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) rebid can be used for another purpose.
- 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) shows 5+ spades and 4+ cards in an undisclosed minor (but does not promise equal-or-longer spades, e.g. opener could be 5=1=1=6).
    - Responder's 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) rebid now asks opener to bid their undisclosed minor. (With a 5=0=4=4, opener will bid the cheaper minor, i.e. 3![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png).)
- 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) shows 6+ spades (and denies 4+ cards in either minor, therefore a 6322 or 6331 hand).
- 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows a 5332 hand.

Responder should rarely pass with an invitiational hand (ca. 9-11 HCP), though they might do so if they suspect a misfit.

If opener has a very strong hand, they can rebid as above but a level higher, which is encouraging but not forcing.

## <a name="1H_opening"> 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) opening

All unbalanced hands (and the occasional 5332 hand) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ hearts are opened 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).

Note that these hands might have a longer (or equal length) spade suit and/or a longer (or equal length) minor suit.

A 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) opening bid is not forcing.

#### Responses to 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) opening

If responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) other than hearts - such that their hand is essentially worthless unless their suit is the trump suit - they should make a [weak response](#Weak_responses_to_1H_opening) (2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png), 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) or 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)).

If responder has a weak hand (ca. 6 HCP or less) with 4+ hearts, they should make a [pre-emptive response](#Pre-emptive_responses_to_1H_opening) (2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png), 3![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) or 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)) - or pass with a very weak hand with exactly 4 hearts and no singleton or void.

If responder has 4+ hearts and ca. 7-11 HCP, they should make a [Bergen response](#Bergen_responses_to_1H_opening) (3![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) or 3![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png)).

If responder has 4+ hearts and ca. 12+ HCP, they should make a [Jacoby 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response](#Jacoby_2NT_response_to_1H_opening) - or, with a singleton or void (but not a singleton Ace) they might prefer a [splinter response](#Splinter_responses_to_1H_opening) instead (3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png), 4![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) or 4![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png)).

If responder has a game-forcing hand - ca. 12+ HCP - and fewer than 4 hearts, they should make a [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1H_opening) (1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)).

If responder has ca. 6-11 HCP and fewer than 4 hearts, they should [respond 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png)](#1NT_response_to_1H_opening).


Otherwise, responder should pass.

### <a name="Weak_responses_to_1H_opening"> Weak responses to 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) opening

When responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) other than hearts, they should make a weak response of 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png), 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) or 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png). (These are analogous to weak jump responses in a standard system.)

Opener should usually pass, though may choose to do otherwise with a strong hand and a good fit for responder's long suit (or if they feel that playing in their long suit will be better).

##### An example

A very weak hand with long diamonds that should make a weak response of 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png):

### <a name="Pre-emptive_responses_to_1H_opening"> Pre-emptive responses to 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) opening

When responder has a weak hand (ca. 6 HCP or less) with 4+ hearts, they should make a pre-emptive raise in hearts:

- With a "weak freak" - 6+ hearts and a singleton or void - they should bid 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).
- With 5+ hearts - and ideally a singleton or void when vulnerable - they should bid 3![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).
- With exactly 4 hearts - or 5+ but no singleton or void - they should bid 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).

(However, with a very weak hand, exactly 4 hearts, and no singleton or void, they should usually pass.)

Opener will usually pass the pre-emptive raise; with a strong hand, they might be able to bid 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) - or, if interested in game following a 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) response, they can:

- Bid a new suit at the cheapest level (i.e. 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png), 3![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) or 3![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png)) to show a weak suit where they fear too many quick losers.
    - If responder has a 1-loser holding in the suit, they bid 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png); otherwise, they bid 3![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).
- Bid 3![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) to show poor quality hearts (e.g. something like T9643).
    - If responder has two honours in hearts, they bid 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png); otherwise, they pass.

When responder has 4+ hearts and ca. 12+ HCP, they should make a game-forcing response of 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png).

(However, with a singleton or void - but not a singleton Ace - they might prefer a [splinter response](#Splinter_responses_to_1H_opening) instead.)

Opener rebids as follows:

- A new suit at the 3-level shows a singleton or void (but not a singleton Ace).
- A new suit at the 4-level shows a good suit (ideally 5+ cards and at least two of the top three honours).
    - Note that after a 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) opening bid and 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response, opener cannot show a good spade suit as 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) takes the auction beyond 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).

    - Responder then relays with 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) and opener rebids as follows:
        - 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in spades.
        - 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in diamonds.

When responder has ca. 6-11 HCP and fewer than 4 hearts, they should make a non-forcing response of 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png).

(Note that this response does not promise a balanced hand.)

If opener is minimum, they can pass (though they might prefer to bid with a very unbalanced hand). Otherwise, opener should rebid as follows:

- 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png), 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png), and 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) show 4+ cards in the suit bid.
    - Note that as 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) is a reverse - in that responder is forced to the 3-level if they want to show a preference for hearts - opener should have considerably more than a minimum hand and/or a very unbalanced hand. (With an intermediate hand with 5+ hearts and 4+ spades, opener should just rebid 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).)
- 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) shows 5+ hearts and denies 4+ cards in either minor (therefore at least 6+ hearts unless opener has exactly 5 hearts and 4+ spades but insufficient strength to reverse).
- 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows a 5332 hand.

Responder should rarely pass with an invitiational hand (ca. 9-11 HCP), though they might do so if they suspect a misfit.

(A 5332 hand with 10-12 HCP and a 5-card major will rarely satisfy the "rule of 20" and should almost always be opened 1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png).)

By partnership agreement, you might decide only to open the 10-12 HCP hands in some circumstances, e.g. only when non-vulnerable or only at favourable vulnerability. You might also decide to open [1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png)](#1NT_opening) instead with the best 12 HCP balanced hands.

A 1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) opening bid is forcing (with one exception).

If responder has ca. 6 HCP or less and a different 5+ card suit, they should make a [weak transfer response](#Weak_transfer_responses_to_1D_opening) (1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png), 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) or 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)).

If responder has invitational strength if opener has a 10-12 HCP hand - ca. 13-14 HCP - and a balanced hand (usually without a 4-card or longer major), they can invite game by [responding 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png)](#1NT_response_to_1D_opening).

Otherwise, responder should make a [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1D_opening) (1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)).

### <a name="Weak_transfer_responses_to_1D_opening"> Weak transfer responses to 1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) opening

When responder has less-than-invitational strength even if opener has a 16-18 HCP hand - ca. 6 HCP or less - and has 5+ cards in a suit other than diamonds, they can make a weak transfer response and then pass opener's forced rebid, as follows:

- With 5+ clubs, they respond 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) and opener is forced to rebid 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png).
- With 5+ hearts, they respond 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) and opener is forced to rebid 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).
- With 5+ spades, they respond 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) and opener is forced to rebid 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).

(Note that with 5+ cards in a major suit, the transfer response is the same as over a 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) opening bid. Although responder could relay with 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) and then transfer, transferring immediately is preferable: relaying would leak information about opener's HCP range - and would also be more vulnerable to interference.)

As mentioned above, with 5+ diamonds, responder can just pass the 1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) opening bid.

(When responder has a 4-card or longer major, they should generally prefer to make a [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1D_opening) instead, then make a Stayman or transfer bid.)

If opener has a 10-12 HCP hand, they should rebid 3![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) with a maximum and pass otherwise.

When responder has ca. 7+ HCP - or ca. 6 HCP or less and no 5+ card suit - they should make a relay response of 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).

(If they have invitational strength if opener has a 10-12 HCP hand - ca. 13-14 HCP - and a balanced hand without a 4-card or longer major, they should generally prefer to invite game by [responding 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png)](#1NT_response_to_1D_opening) instead.)

If opener has a 10-12 HCP hand, they should rebid 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png). Responder then rebids as follows:

- With ca. 6 HCP or less and no 5+ card suit, they should bid 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png). Opener must pass.
- With a less-than-invitational hand (ca. 7-12 HCP):
    - With no 5+ card major (or 6+ card minor), they should bid 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png). Opener must pass.
    - With 5+ spades, they should pass.
    - With 5+ hearts, they should transfer (with 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png), as over a 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) opening bid) and pass opener's forced 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) rebid.
    - With a 6+ card minor, they can transfer (with 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) for clubs or 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) for diamonds, as over a 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) opening bid) - and pass opener's forced rebid if they feel that 3![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) or 3![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) will be better than 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png).
- Otherwise, responder's rebids are analogous to the [responses to a 1NT opening bid](#Responses_to_1NT_opening) (albeit taking into account that opener's point range is 10-12 HCP, not 13-15 HCP).

If opener has a 16-18 HCP hand, they should rebid 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png). Responder's rebids are analogous to the [responses to a 1NT opening bid](#Responses_to_1NT_opening) (albeit taking into account that opener's point range is 16-18 HCP, not 13-15 HCP).


## <a name="1C_opening"> 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) opening

All unbalanced hands with ca. 11-19 HCP and without a 4-card or longer major suit - and all balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hands with 19-21 HCP - are opened 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png).

(As usual, a 5332 hand with 19-21 HCP and a 5-card major can be opened [1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)](#1S_opening) or [1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)](#1H_opening) if it does not feel "no-trumpy" - though with 19-21 HCP, that is unlikely.)

A 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) opening bid is forcing.

##### Some examples

#### Responses to 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) opening

If responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) - such that their hand is essentially worthless unless their suit is the trump suit - they should make a [weak response](#Weak_responses_to_1C_opening) (1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png), 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png), 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) or 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)).

If responder has a weak hand - ca. 5 HCP of less - and no long suit, they should make a [negative response](#Negative_response_to_1C_opening) (1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png)).

If responder has game-forcing hand - ca. 12+ HCP - they should make a [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1C_opening) (1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)).

If responder has ca. 6-11 HCP, they should [respond 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png)](#1NT_response_to_1c_opening).

### <a name="Weak_responses_to_1C_opening"> Weak responses to 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) opening

When responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards), they should make a weak response of 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png), 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png), 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) or 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png). (These are analogous to weak jump responses in a standard system.)

Opener should usually pass, though may choose to do otherwise with a strong hand and a good fit for responder's long suit (or if they feel that playing in their long minor will be better).

##### Some examples

A very weak hand with long spades that should make a weak response of 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png):

A weak hand with strength concentrated in the long suit that should make a weak response of 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png):

> ![spade](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/spade.png)J32![heart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/heart.png)64![diamond](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/diamond.png)87![club](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/club.png)KQT975 -- semi-balanced (3=_2_=_2_=**6**) | 6 HCP

### <a name="Negative_response_to_1C_opening"> Negative response to 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) opening

When responder has a very weak hand - ca. 5 HCP or less - and no long suit, they should make a negative response of 1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png).

Opener rebids as follows:

- With 5+ diamonds, they pass. (This will occasionally mean playing in a 5- or 6-card diamond fit. Can't win 'em all.)
- With exactly 4 diamonds and 5 clubs, they rebid 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png). (Note that since they would not have opened 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) with a 4-card major, they cannot have a major suit void: with 4=0=4=5 or 0=4=4=5, they would have opened 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) or 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) respectively.) Responder then rebids as follows:
    - With 6+ hearts (therefore at least a 7-card fit) and no 9-card or longer minor suit fit, they pass.
    - With 6+ spades (therefore at least a 7-card fit) and no 9-card or longer minor suit fit, they bid 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png). Opener must pass.
    - With at least a 7-card fit in one or both minors, they bid the longer fit (i.e. 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) or 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png)). Opener must pass.
    - Otherwise, they bid 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png). Opener must pass.
- With a balanced hand and 19-21 HCP, they rebid 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png). Responder will often pass, though they can use garbage Stayman or transfers (as over a 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) opening bid) as appropriate - or even invite game (via Stayman or a transfer) with 4-5 HCP.
- With 6+ clubs, they rebid 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png). Responder must pass.

### <a name="Relay_response_to_1C_opening"> Relay response to 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) opening

When responder has a game-forcing hand - ca. 12+ HCP - they should make a relay response of 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).

Opener rebids as follows:

- 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) shows both minors with equal or longer clubs (i.e. at least 5-4 in clubs and diamonds).
- 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows a balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hand with 19-21 HCP.
- 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) shows a single-suited hand with 6+ clubs.
- 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) shows a single-suited hand with 6+ diamonds.
- 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) shows both minors with longer diamonds (i.e. at least 4-5 in clubs and diamonds).

### <a name="1NT_response_to_1C_opening"> 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response to 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) opening

When responder has ca. 6-11 HCP, they should make a non-forcing response of 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png).

(Note that this response does not promise a balanced hand.)

If opener is minimum, they can pass (though they might prefer to bid with a very unbalanced hand). Otherwise, opener should rebid as follows:

- 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) shows a single-suited hand with 6+ clubs.
- 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) shows a single-suited hand with 6+ diamonds.
- 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) shows both minors with longer diamonds (i.e. at least 4-5 in clubs and diamonds).
- 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) shows both minors with equal or longer clubs (i.e. at least 5-4 in clubs and diamonds).
- 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows a balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hand with 19-21 HCP.

Responder should rarely pass opener's 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png), 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png), 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) or 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) rebids with an invitiational hand (ca. 9-11 HCP), though they might do so if they suspect a misfit. (They should never pass if opener rebids 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png).)

If opener has a very strong and unbalanced hand, they can rebid as above but a level higher, which is encouraging but not forcing. (There is no need to jump rebid when they have a balanced hand with 19-21 HCP.)
