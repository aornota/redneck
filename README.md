# <a name="Introduction"> Introduction

Redneck is an experimental Bridge bidding system invented by Jack and Neph after one bottle of wine too many.

It has the following notable features:

- All balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hands with 10-21 HCP can be shown - divided into four separate HCP ranges - at the 1-level (assuming no interference).
- All unbalanced hands with ca. 11-19 HCP and containing at least one 4-card or longer major suit are opened [1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)](#1S_opening) or [1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)](#1H_opening), even if they have a longer (or equal length) minor suit.
- All unbalanced hands with ca. 11-19 HCP and without a 4-card or longer major suit are opened [1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png)](#1C_opening).

Specifically, the 1-level openings bids are as follows:

- [1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png)](#1NT_opening) shows a balanced hand with 13-15 HCP. (By partnership agreement, the best 12 HCP balanced hands can also be included.) This bid is not forcing.
- [1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)](#1S_opening) shows an unbalanced hand (or occasionally 5332) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ spades and fewer than 4 hearts. It might have a longer (or equal length) minor suit. This bid is not forcing.
- [1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)](#1H_opening) shows an unbalanced hand (or occasionally 5332) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ hearts. It might have a longer (or equal length) spade suit and/or a longer (or equal length) minor suit. This bid is not forcing.
- [1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png)](#1D_opening) shows a balanced hand with either 10-12 HCP or 16-18 HCP. (As noted above, by partnership agreement, the best 12 HCP balanced hands can be opened 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) instead.) This bid is forcing (with one exception).
- [1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png)](#1C_opening) shows either an unbalanced hand with ca. 11-19 HCP and without a 4-card or longer major - or a balanced hand with 19-21 HCP. This bid is forcing.

### <a name="1NT_opening"> 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) opening

All balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hands with 13-15 HCP should be opened 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) - except that a 5332 hand with a 5-card major can be opened [1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)](#1S_opening) or [1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)](#1H_opening) if it does not feel "no-trumpy", e.g. if values are concentrated in the major.

A 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) opening bid is not forcing.

By partnership agreement, you might also open 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) (rather than [1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png)](#1D_opening)) with the best 12 HCP balanced hands.

##### Some examples

A balanced hand with 14 HCP and scattered honours that should be opened 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png):

A balanced hand with a "bad" 12 HCP - 4333 and "quacky" with poor intermediates and only 1 quick trick - that should be opened [1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png)](#1D_opening) instead:

A balanced hand with 13 HCP and values concentrated in the 5-card major that could be opened [1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)](#1S_opening) instead:

These are all fairly standard: Stayman; transfers; quantitative; and so on.

_Details to follow..._


### <a name="1S_opening"> 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

All unbalanced hands (and the occasional 5332 hand) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ spades and fewer than 4 hearts are opened 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).

Note that these hands might have a longer (or equal length) minor suit.

A 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening bid is not forcing.

##### Some examples

_Coming soon..._


##### Responses to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

If responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) other than spades - such that their hand is essentially worthless unless their suit is the trump suit - they should make a [weak "jump" response](#Weak_jump_responses_to_1S_opening).

If responder has a weak hand (ca. 6 HCP or less) with 4+ spades, they should make a [pre-emptive response](#Pre-emptive_responses_to_1S_opening) (or pass with a very weak hand with exactly 4 spades and no singleton or void).

If responder has 4+ spades and ca. 7-12 HCP, they should make a [Bergen response](#Bergen_responses_to_1S_opening).

If responder has 4+ spades and ca. 13+ HCP, they should make a [Jacoby 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response](#Jacoby_2NT_response_to_1S_opening) - or, with a singleton or void (but not a singleton Ace) they might prefer a [splinter response](#Splinter_responses_to_1S_opening) instead.

If responder has an invitational-or-better hand - ca. 10+ HCP - and fewer than 4 spades, they should make a [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1S_opening).

If responder has ca. 6-9 HCP and fewer than 4 spades, they should [respond 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png)](#1NT_response_to_1S_opening).


Otherwise, responder should pass.

#### <a name="Weak_jump_responses_to_1S_opening"> Weak "jump" responses to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

When responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) other than spades, they should make a weak "jump" response of 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png), 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) or 3![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png). (Note that 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) and 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) are not technically jumps over 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).)

Opener should usually pass, though may choose to do otherwise with a strong hand and a good fit for responder's long suit (or if they feel than playing in their long suit will be better).

##### An example

A very weak hand with long hearts that should make a weak "jump" response of 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png):

> ![spade](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/spade.png)3![heart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/heart.png)KT975432![diamond](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/diamond.png)862![club](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/club.png)5 -- very unbalanced (_1_=**8**=3=_1_) | 3 HCP

#### <a name="Pre-emptive_responses_to_1S_opening"> Pre-emptive responses to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

When responder has a weak hand (ca. 6 HCP or less) with 4+ spades, they should make a pre-emptive raise in spades:

- With a "weak freak" - 6+ spades and a singleton or void - they should bid 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).
- With 5+ spades - and ideally a singleton or void when vulnerable - they should bid 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).
- With exactly 4 spades - or 5+ but no singleton or void - they should bid 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).

(However, with a very weak hand, exactly 4 spades, and no singleton or void, they should usually pass.)

Opener will usually pass the pre-emptive raise; with a strong hand, they might be able to bid 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) - or, if interested in game following a 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) response, they can:

- Bid a new suit at the 3-level to show a weak suit where they fear too many quick losers.
    - If responder has a 1-loser holding in the suit, they bid 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png); otherwise, they bid 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).
- Bid 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) to show poor quality spades (e.g. something like T9643).
    - If responder has two honours in spades, they bid 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png); otherwise, they pass.

#### <a name="Bergen_responses_to_1S_opening"> Bergen responses to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

When responder has 4+ spades and ca. 7-12 HCP, they shuuld bid as follows:

- With 7-9 HCP, they bid 3![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png). Opener can:
    - Rebid 3![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) to invite game (with responder signing-off in 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) or 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)).
    - Sign-off in 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) or 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).
    - Explore for slam.
- With 10-12 HCP, they bid 3![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png). Opener can sign-off in 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) or 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png), or explore for slam.

#### <a name="Jacoby_2NT_response_to_1S_opening"> Jacoby 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

When responder has 4+ spades and ca. 13+ HCP, they should make a game-forcing response of 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png).

(However, with a singleton or void - but not a singleton Ace - they might prefer a [splinter response](#Splinter_responses_to_1S_opening) instead.)

Opener rebids as follows:

- A new suit at the 3-level shows a singleton or void (but not a singleton Ace).
- A new suit at the 4-level shows a good suit (ideally 5+ cards and at least two of the top three honours).
- 3![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) shows a strong hand with 5+ spades.
- 3![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows a strong hand with exactly 4 spades.
- 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) shows a minimum hand.

#### <a name="Splinter_responses_to_1S_opening"> Splinter responses to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

When responder has 4+ spades, ca. 13+ HCP, and a singleton or void (but not a singleton Ace), they should make a game-forcing double-jump response:

- 4![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) shows a singleton or void in clubs.
- 4![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) shows a singleton or void in diamonds.
- 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) shows a singleton or void in hearts.

(However, by partnership agreement, a strong responder might prefer a [Jacoby 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response](#Jacoby_2NT_response_to_1S_opening) instead, e.g. if they want to find out more about opener's hand rather than telling opener about their singleton or void.)

##### Some examples

_Coming soon..._


#### <a name="Relay_response_to_1S_opening"> Relay response to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

When responder has an invitational-or-better hand - ca. 10+ HCP - and fewer than 4 spades, they should make a relay response of 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png).

If minimum, opener rebids as follows:

- 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) shows either a three-suited hand (with a singleton or void in hearts) or a 5322 hand.
    - Responder then relays with 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) and opener rebids as follows:
        - 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in hearts.
        - 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows a 5332 hand.
- 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) shows clubs (at least 5-4 or 4-5 in spades and clubs).
- 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) shows a single-suited hand with 6+ spades.
- 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows diamonds (at least 5-4 or 4-5 in spades and diamonds).

Note that - unlike after a [relay response to a 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) opening bid](#Relay_response_to_1H_opening) - opener's rebids are often unnatural (i.e. not showing 4+ cards in the suit bid). Therefore opener's immediate 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) and 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) rebids hould be treated as semi-forcing (albeit responder will occasionally decide to pass with an appropriate hand).

If strong, opener rebids as above but a level higher; this establishes a game-force.

#### <a name="1NT_response_to_1S_opening"> 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response to 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) opening

When responder has ca. 6-9 HCP and fewer than 4 spades, they should make a non-forcing response of 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png).

(Note that this response does not promise a balanced hand.)

If opener has a strong and/or very unbalanced hand, they can rebid as follows:

- 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png), 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png), and 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) promise 5+ cards in the suit bid.
- 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) promises 6+ spades.
- 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows a 5332 hand.

If opener is strong enough to insist on game, they rebid as above but a level higher.

Note that these hands might have a longer (or equal length) spade suit and/or a longer (or equal length) minor suit.

A 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) opening bid is not forcing.

If responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) other than hearts - such that their hand is essentially worthless unless their suit is the trump suit - they should make a [weak "jump" response](#Weak_jump_responses_to_1H_opening).

If responder has a weak hand (ca. 6 HCP or less) with 4+ hearts, they should make a [pre-emptive response](#Pre-emptive_responses_to_1H_opening) (or pass with a very weak hand with exactly 4 hearts and no singleton or void).

If responder has 4+ hearts and ca. 7-12 HCP, they should make a [Bergen response](#Bergen_responses_to_1H_opening).

If responder has 4+ hearts and ca. 13+ HCP, they should make a [Jacoby 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response](#Jacoby_2NT_response_to_1H_opening) - or, with a singleton or void (but not a singleton Ace) they might prefer a [splinter response](#Splinter_responses_to_1H_opening) instead.

(Note that 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) and 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) are not technically jumps over 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).)

Opener should usually pass, though may choose to do otherwise with a strong hand and a good fit for responder's long suit (or if they feel than playing in their long suit will be better).

##### An example

A very weak hand with long diamonds that should make a weak "jump" response of 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png):

#### <a name="Pre-emptive_responses_to_1H_opening"> Pre-emptive responses to 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) opening

When responder has a weak hand (ca. 6 HCP or less) with 4+ hearts, they should make a pre-emptive raise in hearts:

- With a "weak freak" - 6+ hearts and a singleton or void - they should bid 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).
- With 5+ hearts - and ideally a singleton or void when vulnerable - they should bid 3![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).
- With exactly 4 hearts - or 5+ but no singleton or void - they should bid 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).

(However, with a very weak hand, exactly 4 hearts, and no singleton or void, they should usually pass.)

Opener will usually pass the pre-emptive raise; with a strong hand, they might be able to bid 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) - or, if interested in game following a 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) response, they can:

- Bid a new suit at the 3-level to show a weak suit where they fear too many quick losers.
    - If responder has a 1-loser holding in the suit, they bid 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png); otherwise, they bid 3![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).
- Bid 3![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) to show poor quality hearts (e.g. something like T9643).
    - If responder has two honours in hearts, they bid 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png); otherwise, they pass.

When responder has 4+ hearts and ca. 13+ HCP, they should make a game-forcing response of 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png).

(However, with a singleton or void - but not a singleton Ace - they might prefer a [splinter response](#Splinter_responses_to_1H_opening) instead.)

Opener rebids as follows:

- A new suit at the 3-level shows a singleton or void (but not a singleton Ace).
- A new suit at the 4-level shows a good suit (ideally 5+ cards and at least two of the top three honours).
    - Note that after a 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) opening bid and 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) response, opener cannot show a good spade suit as 4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) takes the auction beyond 4![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png). (4![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) would be RKCB for hearts if the partnership plays Kickback.)
- 3![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) shows a strong hand with 5+ hearts.
- 3![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows a strong hand with exactly 4 hearts.

When responder has an invitational-or-better hand - ca. 10+ HCP - and fewer than 4 hearts, they should make a relay response of 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).

If minimum, opener rebids as follows:

- 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows either a three-suited hand (4441 or 5440) or a 5322 hand.
    - Responder then relays with 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) and opener rebids as follows:
        - 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in spades.
        - 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in diamonds.
        - 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in clubs.
        - 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) shows a 5332 hand.
- 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) shows clubs (at least 5-4 or 4-5 in hearts and clubs).
- 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) shows diamonds (at least 5-4 or 4-5 in hearts and diamonds).

- 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) shows spades (at least 5-4 or 4-5 in hearts and spades).

Note that other than the 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) rebid (which forces responder to relay with 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png)), opener's rebids are natural - showing 4+ cards in the suit bid - and non-forcing.

If strong, opener rebids as above but a level higher; this establishes a game-force.

If opener has a strong and/or very unbalanced hand, they can rebid as follows:

### <a name="1D_opening"> 1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) opening

All balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hands with either 10-12 HCP or 16-18 HCP should be opened 1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) - except that a 5332 hand with 16-18 HCP and a 5-card major can be opened [1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png)](#1S_opening) or [1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png)](#1H_opening) if it does not feel "no-trumpy", e.g. if values are concentrated in the major.

(A 5332 hand with 10-12 HCP and a 5-card major will rarely satisfy the "rule of 20" and should almost always be opened 1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png).)

By partnership agreement, you might decide only to open the 10-12 HCP hands in some circumstances, e.g. only when non-vulnerable or only at favourable vulnerability. You might also decide to open [1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png)](#1NT_opening) instead with the best 12 HCP balanced hands.

A 1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) opening bid is forcing (with one exception).

##### Responses to 1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) opening

If responder has less-than-invitational strength even if opener has a 16-18 HCP hand - ca. 6 HCP or less - and has 5+ diamonds, they should pass.

If responder has ca. 6 HCP or less and a different 5+ card suit, they should make a [weak transfer response](#Weak_transfer_responses_to_1D_opening).

If responder has invitational strength if opener has a 10-12 HCP hand - ca. 13-14 HCP - and a balanced hand (usually without a 4-card or longer major), they can invite game by [responding 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png)](#1NT_response_to_1D_opening).

Otherwise, responder should make a [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1D_opening).

#### <a name="Weak_transfer_responses_to_1D_opening"> Weak transfer responses to 1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) opening

When responder has less-than-invitational strength even if opener has a 16-18 HCP hand - ca. 6 HCP or less - and has 5+ cards in a suit other than diamonds, they can make a weak transfer response and then pass opener's forced rebid, as follows:

- With 5+ clubs, they respond 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) and opener is forced to rebid 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png).
- With 5+ hearts, they respond 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) and opener is forced to rebid 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).
- With 5+ spades, they respond 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) and opener is forced to rebid 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).

(Note that with 5+ cards in a major suit, the transfer response is the same as over a 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) opening bid. Although responder could relay with 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) and then transfer, transferring immediately is preferable: relaying would leak information about opener's HCP range - and would also be more vulnerable to interference.)

As mentioned above, with 5+ diamonds, responder can just pass the 1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) opening bid.

##### An example

A less-than-invitational hand with 5+ clubs that should make a weak transfer response of 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png), then pass opener's forced 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) rebid:

When responder has invitational strength if opener has a 10-12 HCP hand - ca. 13-14 HCP - and a balanced hand (usually without a 4-card or longer major), they can invite game by responding 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png).

(When responder has a 4-card or longer major, they should generally prefer to make a [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1D_opening) instead, then make a Stayman or transfer bid.)

If opener has a 10-12 HCP hand, they should rebid 3![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) with a maximum and pass otherwise.

If opener has a 15-17 HCP hand, they should rebid 3![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) (or explore for a thin slam).

If opener has a 10-12 HCP hand, they should rebid 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png). Responder then rebids as follows:

- With ca. 6 HCP or less and no 5+ card suit, they should bid 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png). Opener must pass.
- With a less-than-invitational hand - ca. 7-12 HCP - and no 5+ card major (or 6+ card minor) - they should bid 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png). Opener must pass.
    - With a less-than-invitational hand and a 5+ card major, they should transfer - as over a 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) opening bid - and pass opener's forced rebid.
    - With a less-than-invitational hand and a 6+ card minor, they can transfer and pass opener's forced rebid if they feel that 3![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) or 3![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) will be better than 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png).
- Otherwise, responder's rebids are analogous to the [responses to a 1NT opening bid](#Responses_to_1NT_opening) (albeit taking into account that opener's point range is 10-12 HCP, not 13-15 HCP).

If opener has a 16-18 HCP hand, they should rebid 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png).

##### Responses to 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) opening

If responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) - such that their hand is essentially worthless unless their suit is the trump suit - they should make a [weak "jump" response](#Weak_jump_responses_to_1C_opening).

If responder has a weak hand - ca. 5 HCP of less - and no long suit, they should make a [negative response](#Negative_response_to_1C_opening).

If responder has ca. 6+ HCP, they should make a [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1C_opening).

#### <a name="Weak_jump_responses_to_1C_opening"> Weak "jump" responses to 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) opening

When responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards), they should make a weak "jump" response of 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png), 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png), 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) or 2![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png). (Note that 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) and 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) are not technically jumps over 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png).)

Opener should usually pass, though may choose to do otherwise with a strong hand and a good fit for responder's long suit (or if they feel than playing in their long minor will be better).

#### <a name="Negative_response_to_1C_opening"> Negative response to 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) opening

When responder has a very weak hand - ca. 5 HCP or less - and no long suit, they should make a negative response of 1![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png).

Opener rebids as follows:

- With 5+ diamonds, they pass. (This will occasionally mean playing in a 5- or 6-card diamond fit. Can't win 'em all.)
- With exactly 4 diamonds and 5 clubs, they rebid 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png). (Note that since they would not have opened 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) with a 4-card major, they cannot have a major suit void: with 4=0=4=5 or 0=4=4=5, they would have opened 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png) or 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png) respectively.) Responder then rebids as follows:
    - With 6+ hearts (therefore at least a 7-card fit) and no 9-card or longer minor suit fit, they pass.
    - With 6+ spades (therefore at least a 7-card fit) and no 9-card or longer minor suit fit, they bid 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png). Opener must pass.
    - With at least a 7-card fit in one or both minors, they bid the longer fit (i.e. 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png) or 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png)). Opener must pass.
    - Otherwise, they bid 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png). Opener must pass.
- With a balanced hand and 19-21 HCP, they rebid 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png). Responder will often pass, though they can use garbage Stayman or transfers (as over a 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) opening bid) as appropriate - or even invite game (via Stayman or a transfer) with 4-5 HCP.
- With 6+ clubs, they rebid 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png). Responder must pass.

#### <a name="Relay_response_to_1C_opening"> Relay response to 1![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png) opening

When responder has ca. 6+ HCP, they should make a relay response of 1![H](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/H.png).

Opener rebids as follows:

- With both minor suits (at least 5-4) and a minimum hand, they rebid 1![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).
    - Responder can then relay with 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) to ask opener to rebid their longer (or stronger if equal length) minor at the 2-level - or, if short in both minors, improvise some other bid.
- With a balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hand and 19-21 HCP, they rebid 1![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png).
    - Responder's rebids are analogous to the [responses to a 1NT opening bid](#Responses_to_1NT_opening) (albeit taking into account that opener's point range is 19-21 HCP, not 13-15 HCP).
- With 6+ clubs and a minimum hand, they rebid 2![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png).
- With 6+ diamonds and a minimum hand, they rebid 2![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png).
- With both minor suits (at least 5-4) and a strong hand, they rebid 2![S](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/S.png).
    - Responder can then relay with 2![NT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/NT.png) to ask opener to rebid their longer (or stronger if equal length) minor at the 3-level - or, if short in both minors, improvise some other bid.
- With 6+ clubs and a strong hand, they rebid 3![C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/C.png).
- With 6+ diamonds and a strong hand, they rebid 3![D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aornota/redneck/main/src/resources/D.png).
